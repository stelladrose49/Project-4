# iStar Phones: iStar H1

### The iStar Phone H1 was created from three concepts; to share our passion for the cellular industry, methods of research and analysis, and goals of bringing a reliable, affordable, and user-friendly phone to the market‚Ä¶ a market where as of 2020, is filled with over 5 billion users.
### We took the time to research reviews online via bestbuy.com to look at common words used and average rating for the top phone models of 2023.

### During the presentation, we delved into the evolution of smartphones, highlighting key advancements that were integrated into mobile phones as technology progressed.
### We also analyzed the comparison between Amazon reviews and ratings for various phone brands spanning from 2005 to 2019. Samsung emerged as the most reviewed phone brand, accumulating close to 40,000 reviews, while ASUS received the lowest number of reviews. Interestingly, Xiaomi attained the highest rating, nearing almost 4.5 stars out of 5, while Nokia received the lowest rating. Despite being the most reviewed, Samsung ranked third lowest in terms of ratings among the phone brands discussed. Additionally, we briefly covered a little bit of history behind Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi.
### Furthermore, we examined market competition, drawing insights from data obtained from http://companiesmarketcap.com/

### Price Predictor ModelNow that we have more information on the smartphone market, we can now create a phone that is accurately priced and contains features that people want most on their devices. Our company iStar is planning on releasing 2 phone models: the H1 pro and H1 pro plus, and we will demonstrate how our price predictor model and language sentiment text topic models work based on the most important features on our phones. We could pick and choose the most important features to have on our phones based on a machine learning model that we created from a data set with vast information about different phone brands and features. From the data set, we could scale the different features using standard scaler to determine which features people wanted the most on their phones.Predicted vs. Actual Price: our predicted vs actual price graph has a positive linear relationship so as the predicted price increases, so does the actual price.Learning Curve: the training score curve illustrates the model's performance on the training data, it remains at a high level indicating a good fit from the training data.
### the cross-validation score curve shows the model's performance on the cross-validation data set which evaluated the model's generalization ability to unseen data.
### As training data increases, the cross-validation score gradually improves, indicating better generalization with more data.By using our model, we were also able to assign different weights and values to the different features to create our price prediction model. So depending on what type of brand and storage and battery, camera you want on your phone, the predicted price will either increase or decrease based on the varying features.
